## Quick Start

Install components with one command:

```bash
npx @aneka-ui/cli init
npx @aneka-ui/cli add button card badge
```

Then use them in your project:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Welcome to Aneka UI</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <Button>Get Started</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Why Aneka UI?

**Patterns, Not Colors** - Aneka UI provides authentic design system patterns (spacing, typography, motion) while you provide the colors. This gives you brand consistency while following design system best practices.

**Framework-Native** - React components use `forwardRef` and hooks. Vue components use Composition API. Angular components use standalone components. No wrappers, no compromises.

**Copy-Paste Philosophy** - Components are copied to your project, not installed as dependencies. You own the code and can modify it freely.

## Design Systems Included

- **Material Design** - Google's design language with 8pt grid, elevation shadows, and 200ms animations
- **Apple HIG** - Apple's Human Interface Guidelines with subtle shadows and spring-like animations
- **Samsung One UI** - Samsung's design system with generous spacing and bold typography
