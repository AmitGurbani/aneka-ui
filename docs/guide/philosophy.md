Understanding the principles behind Aneka UI.

## Core Principles

### 1. Patterns, Not Colors

Aneka UI provides **design patterns** (spacing, typography, motion) while you provide **colors**.

This means you get:

- ✅ Authentic design system patterns
- ✅ Your brand colors throughout
- ✅ Best practices from Google, Apple, Samsung
- ✅ Flexibility to customize

### 2. Copy-Paste Ownership

Components are copied to your codebase, not installed as dependencies.

Benefits:

- ✅ Full control over the code
- ✅ No version lock-in
- ✅ Easy to customize
- ✅ No breaking updates

### 3. Framework-Native

True framework implementations, not wrappers.

- **React**: Uses forwardRef, hooks, proper patterns
- **Vue**: Uses Composition API, Vue 3 features
- **Angular**: Uses standalone components, signals
